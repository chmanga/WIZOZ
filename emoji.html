            <h1 class="c1">The Magical Journey through Oz</h1>
            <p>The Wizard of Oz is one of the most beloved and iconic stories of all time. First introduced to the world in 1900 by L. Frank Baum, the tale has been cherished by generations of readers, viewers, and adventurers alike. The story of Dorothy, a young girl from Kansas, who is swept away to the magical land of Oz by a tornado, captures the imagination with its unforgettable characters, enchanted landscapes, and memorable adventures.</p>
            <p>As Dorothy journeys along the Yellow Brick Road to meet the Wizard, she befriends three remarkable companions: the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. Together, they face challenges, discover their strengths, and realize that what they sought was already within them. The Wizard of Oz is a tale of self-discovery, courage, friendship, and the importance of home.</p>
            <h2 class="c2">The Enchanting Land of Oz</h2>
            <p>The land of Oz is divided into four distinct regions, each with its own unique culture, characters, and magic. From the peaceful Munchkinland in the East to the mysterious Wicked Witch of the West’s dark domain, the world of Oz is filled with adventure at every turn. As Dorothy’s journey unfolds, we are introduced to magical beings, powerful witches, and countless wonders.</p>
            <h2 class="c3">Symbols and Themes</h2>
